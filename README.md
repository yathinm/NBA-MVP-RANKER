## üìä MVP Scoring Algorithms

The application uses multiple sophisticated scoring algorithms:

### 1. Basic MVP Score (Original)
```
MVP_Score = (PTS √ó 0.4) + (AST √ó 0.2) + (TRB √ó 0.2) + (STL √ó 0.1) + (BLK √ó 0.1)
```

### 2. Advanced MVP Score (Efficiency-Based)
```
Advanced_Score = (PTS_PG √ó 0.35) + (AST_PG √ó 0.25) + (TRB_PG √ó 0.20) + 
                 (STL_PG √ó 0.10) + (BLK_PG √ó 0.10) + (TS% √ó 50) + (AST_TO_RATIO √ó 2)
```

### 3. Position-Adjusted Score
Position-specific weights that account for role expectations:
- **Point Guards**: Higher assist weight (40%)
- **Centers**: Higher rebound and block weights (35%, 25%)
- **Forwards**: Balanced scoring and rebounding (35%, 20%)

### 4. Team Impact Score
Measures performance relative to team averages:
```
Team_Impact = Basic_Score + ((Player_Stats - Team_Average) √ó 0.1)
```

### 5. Composite Score (Final Ranking)
Weighted combination of all methods:
```
Composite = (Basic √ó 0.3) + (Advanced √ó 0.3) + (Position √ó 0.2) + (Team_Impact √ó 0.2)
```

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Demo Script
To quickly see all the enhanced features in action:

```bash
python3 demo.py
```

This will run the enhanced analysis and showcase all the new features.

## üöÄ How to Run

### Prerequisites

1. **Python 3.7+** installed on your system
2. **Java 8 or higher** installed on your system
3. **NBA player statistics CSV file** (e.g., `NBA_2024_per_game.csv`)

### Step 1: Enhanced Data Processing (Python)

1. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/NBA-MVP-RANKER
   ```

2. **Install Python dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   Or manually:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
   ```

3. **Run the enhanced Python script:**
   ```bash
   # Basic usage
   python NBAMVPSORTEREnhanced.py
   
   # Advanced usage with options
   python NBAMVPSORTEREnhanced.py --input NBA_2024_per_game.csv --top 15 --no-viz
   ```

   **Command Line Options:**
   - `--input, -i`: Specify input CSV file (default: NBA_2024_per_game.csv)
   - `--top, -t`: Number of top players to display (default: 10)
   - `--no-viz`: Skip visualization generation
   - `--export-only`: Only export data, skip analysis display

   This will:
   - Load and preprocess NBA statistics
   - Calculate multiple MVP scoring algorithms
   - Generate comprehensive analysis
   - Display top MVP candidates with detailed statistics
   - Export results to CSV and JSON formats
   - Create data visualizations (if matplotlib/seaborn available)

### Step 2: Enhanced GUI Viewer (Java)
